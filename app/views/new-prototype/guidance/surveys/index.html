  If you plan to use a questionnaire survey in your research, you must get a peer review by a user research Survey Champion, and you must only use the approved DfE survey software to publish it.

  This is important because it reduces risks to DfE and our users. It helps ensure that the data and insight generated from your survey can be trusted and used with confidence, and that you treat survey recipients ethically and without causing them burden.

  A questionnaire survey uses structured questions to collect data that can be quantitatively analysed and used to provide statistically valid findings.
  
  Other types of survey, where you only plan to collect unstructured or qualitative data, which won't be presented as statistically valid findings, then you don't have to get a Survey Champion peer review. However, you must still only use DfE approved survey software.
  
  ## How to decide whether a questionnaire survey is the right method
  
  Questionnaire surveys are not a core user research method, because they are intended to quantify knowledge, attitudes or beliefs from a large number of people, rather than qualitatively study needs and behaviours.
  
  You and your team must therefore be clear about the purpose of your survey and whether it will provide the right insight and value to your project.
  
  You must be confident that your question design will give you the level of detail you need, and that your sampling strategy will provide statistically valid findings – or, if not, that the results will not be treated as quantitative evidence for decision making. 
  
  You must also first explore other options to get the data you need. There may be existing DfE data and insight sources where your research questions have already been answered. Alternatively, there may be existing regular questionnaire surveys sent out to DfE service users, where you could add your questions.

  ## Get a peer review from a DfE survey champion

  Before you can get access to the approved DfE survey tool, you must get a peer review of your survey design by a user research survey champion, and you must make any changes that they advise.
  
  Survey champions are DfE user researchers with expertise in survey design. They will give you help, advice and feedback to:
  
  -	design a high-quality survey
  -	reduce any risks linked to your survey
  
  Design your questionnaire survey in a Word document and share it with a survey champion, who will peer review it and aim to give you feedback within 3 working days.

  </div>
   
  
  ### What happens in a survey peer review
  
  Your survey will be reviewed against a set of criteria covering the survey purpose, design, sampling, ethics, data handling, quality assurance and analysis plans.
    
  The survey champion will give you feedback within 3 working days. 
  
  In rare cases the survey champion may decide that your survey is high risk, and will submit it to a lead or senior user researcher for review. This may be because the survey covers contentious topics, may duplicate existing surveys or data, or because the survey champion wants a second opinion on questions about the design, sample, ethical approach, or potential reputational risk.

  ## Get access to the approved DfE survey tool
  
  You must only use the approved survey tool to publish a questionnaire survey. 
  
  Access to this tool is managed by the research operations team. Before being given access, you will need to show your survey champion peer review outcome.
  
  Using this tool helps ensure good design, presented, distribution and analysis of your survey, as well as giving you the ability to combine your survey data with other data sources. It also ensures that the data you generate is stored securely.
  
  This tool is funded centrally, and there is no licence cost to your team, programme or portfolio. You will be given access to the tool for the length of time that you need to run your survey and analyse it.

        Request access to the approved survey tool (DfE users only)
      </a>
    </span>
  </div>
  
  ### Using any other survey software
  
  In some exceptional situations, you may be given an exemption to use a different tool to run a questionnaire survey.
  
  This could be because your team has purchased and already uses a different survey tool, or a specialist user research platform which includes survey functionality. 

  To use any alternative tool, you will need permission for the head of user research. You will need to demonstrate why the normal approved tool doesn't meet the needs of your research or your team.
