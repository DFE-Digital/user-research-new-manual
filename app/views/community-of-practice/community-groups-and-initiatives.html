## Ethics Club

Ethics Club is our community's working group for everything related to ethics in user research at DfE.

It is open for any user researcher (civil servant or contractor) to join

It was born in the Vulnerable Children and Families portfolio in 2020 and grew into a truly collaborative cross-DfE working group.

Everything we do aims to ensure we stick to the DfE UR Principles - especially  “We do high quality, safe and ethical research” and “We learn as a community and by ourselves”

We aim to do this by

- Helping User Researchers make the best/optimal ethical decisions for their context
- Ensuring User Researchers feel confident their research methods are ethically sound

We have produced, and are continuing to produce, <a href="">ethics and safeguarding guidance</a> for DfE user researchers, and other guidance on topics like inclusive research, using incentives, and others.

We also offer objective, non-judgemental, ad-hoc peer advice to any DfE user researcher wrangling with tricky ethical issues in their research. You can ask questions in the <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C03MMLGDC4B">#ethicsadvisorygroup channel in DfE Slack</a>.

We are always thinking of new ways to help User Researchers in our community upload high ethical standards in their practice. We are now focused on:

- improving URs' access to the right support
- sharing and learning practices across government
- making sure we understand user researchers' needs
- iterating the guidance and supporting the development of DfE UR standards

If you have a passion for research ethics, want to get to know other URs in the DfE, learn new things or help grow the UR community, you can join ethics club by <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/D035UMKKC81">contacting Will Finn in DfE Slack</a>.

If you're from another government department, and are interested in what we're doing in Ethics Club, <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/team/U035AV4PUNN">contact Will in cross-government Slack</a>.


## Community initiatives and interest groups

Whatever your interest in user research, there are probably other researchers in our community who share it. We have lots of voluntary working groups who work together on community initiatives, as well as interest groups who come come together to talk about a shared interest, share experiences, and sometimes design best practice.

We invite and encourage every user researcher to get involved with a working group or interest group. This includes contractors: we really value the expertise and experiences you bring from other organisations you've worked in.

For civil servant user researchers, actively contributing to one of these groups could form your <a href="/your-ur-career-at-dfe/able-objectives.html"> profession objective. </a>

Our current groups are listed below, with the people to contact if you would like to get involved.

If you don't see a group formed around your interest, then why not start it yourself? Use our community Slack channels to find people who share the interest, get together, and <a href="">let us know if you create a working group so we can add it to this page</a>.

### Working groups

As well as to allow people with a shared interest to come together, our working groups have been set up to create community-led improvements to our user research practice at DfE. They each have a defined goal, and will create outputs: for example, our Ethics working group was set up to deliver guidance for ethical user research, and help develop our user research standards.

Some of these groups are focused on developing UR practice and capability across the whole of DfE. Others have been formed to experiment around a topic in a single programme or portfolio, in order to identify changes that might in the future be rolled out across DfE.

These groups will be led by, or will have involvement from, a Lead User Researcher or the Head of User Research.

| __Working group__  | __Contact__ | __Purpose__ |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| __Community strategy__ | Tom Adams | Working group to establish and maintain a strong UR Community of Practice at DfE through delivery of community meet-ups, and creating and implementing a strategy that allows URs to share and apply skills and build relationships with other URs across the department |
| __Ethics working group (Ethics Club)__ | Will Finn | Working group to create and embed ethical standards for our community, and provide ad hoc peer advice through the ethics advisory group sub-group within Ethics Club |
| __Training working group__ | Annaliese Lamb | Set up to develop a training proposition indicating where training material for developing skills can be found and, for creating training materials, for progression for all UR grades |
| __Collaborating with other professions__ (Teacher Services action team) | Will Finn | A multidisciplinary action group based in Teacher Services, identifying ideas for how qualitative and quantitative professions can collaborate to solve whole problems for users |
| __Peer reviews__ (Teacher Services action team) | Alex Harris | A team in Teacher Services aiming to develop and test a nimble peer review process for user research plans |
| __Teacher recruitment__ (Teacher Services action team) | Will Finn | A team aiming to resolve challenges with recruiting participants for Teacher Services |
| __Mentoring programme__ (Teacher Services action team) | Sarah Walmsley | A team aiming to develop a mentoring programme to help people get involved in mentoring as a mentor or mentee |


### Interest groups

Interest groups are self-formed and self-directed by user researchers in our community, sometimes alongside colleagues from other professions. They are normally formed around a single topic, and (unlike working groups) they don't necessarily have a defined goal or output (although members may decide that they want to create something, for example a standard or guidance). They exist for us to come together and talk with likeminded friends about the topics that interest us.

| __Interest group__  | __Contact__ | __Topic__ |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| __Ethnography__ | Vale Mazzi | A forum to reflect on and learn about ethnographic approaches, consider best practice, and discuss how it can be applied to our work. |
| __Junior user researchers__ | <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C016SURGCMC">#junior_user_researchers</a> | Slack channel for junior user researchers to share their knowledge, learnings and experiences, and to seek and give support to fellow junior user researchers. |
| __Co-design community__ | Sarah Thew | Group for anyone interested in codesign methods and approaches | 
| __Internal research__ | Adam Dumbell | A group of URs doing internal research. We meet once every couple weeks to discuss what we're working on, any issues, and suggestions |
| __Storytelling__ |  | A group for sharing knowledge and experience of storytelling techniques. We discuss how to use storytelling to communicate and convince |
