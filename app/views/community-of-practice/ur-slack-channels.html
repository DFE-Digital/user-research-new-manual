Our channels in Department for Education Slack are a great place to meet, speak to and get advice from other DfE user researchers. 

All civil servant and contractor user researchers should be given Slack access when you join DfE. If not, you can <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/signup">sign up manually here</a>. You will need an education.gov.uk email address to join.

You can also join the cross-government Slack user research channels to meet and talk to user researchers from other government departments. Anybody with a .gov.uk email address can sign up at <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/">ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com</a>.
