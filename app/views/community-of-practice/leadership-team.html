As head of user research, Tom's job is to develop our professional capability across the department, and create a culture and working practices that encourage and enable great user research. Tom owns and is responsible for delivering our profession strategy and roadmap.

He advocates for user research in the department, and also joins up with other heads of user research to do this cross-government.

As lead user researchers, Charly, Ella, Kathryn and Will coordinate research and manage the user research team in a single area of DfE. They are responsible for ensuring their user researchers are meeting our professional standards, and that they are coming together to share their insight and building a single user-centred picture of our different user groups.

Our goal is to have a lead user researcher to support every portoflio of work in DfE. Weâ€™re working on this.
