When you join DfE, you're joining a friendly group of passionate professionals, who want to deliver great research for our teams, and make a real difference to the users of DfE services and policies. It's our <a href="/community-of-practice/how-were-developing-ur-at-dfe.html">goal to make Department for Education the best place in government to be a user researcher</a> and our active and supportive community of practice is a big part of that.

We regularly come together in <a href="/community-of-practice/community-meetups.html">community of practice meetups</a>, have active and friendly <a href="/community-of-practice/ur-slack-channels.html">Slack channels</a>, and various <a href="/community-of-practice/community-initiatives-and-interest-groups.html">community initiatives, working groups and interest groups</a> to get involved in.

                Our UR community principles for delivering great user research
            </h2>
            <p>Together we created a set of principles describing how we deliver our best work as DfE user researchers.</p>
            <p>These principles are:</p>
            <ol class="dfe-list--number" style="padding-left:30px">
              <li>We include all of our users, and bring them to the heart of the departmentâ€™s work</li>
              <li>We are objective and use evidence</li>
              <li>We do high quality, safe and ethical research</li>
              <li>We are adaptable and collaborative, and focus our research in the right places</li>
              <li>We learn as a community and by ourselves</li>
              <li>We celebrate our work, and help others understand what we do</li>
            </ol>
            <p><a href="/community-of-practice/principles.html">Read more about our principles, what they mean, and how we apply them.</a></p>
            <p>We used these principles to design our mission patch sticker, which shows an otter looking for insights. Like us, otters are collaborative, adaptable, and effective as individuals with a strong sense of community.</p>
