                  Our UR community principles for delivering great user research
              </h2>
              <p>Together we created a set of principles describing how we deliver our best work as DfE user researchers.</p>
              <p>These principles are:</p>
              <ol class="dfe-list--number" style="padding-left:30px">
                <li>We include all of our users, and bring them to the heart of the department’s work</li>
                <li>We are objective and use evidence</li>
                <li>We do high quality, safe and ethical research</li>
                <li>We are adaptable and collaborative, and focus our research in the right places</li>
                <li>We learn as a community and by ourselves</li>
                <li>We celebrate our work, and help others understand what we do</li>
              </ol>
              <p><a href="/community-of-practice/principles.html">Read more about our principles, what they mean, and how we apply them.</a></p>
              <p>We used these principles to design our mission patch sticker, which shows an otter looking for insights. Like us, otters are collaborative, adaptable, and effective as individuals with a strong sense of community.</p>
