## Summary

As a user researcher, you will collect lots of data from and about your research participants, much of which is 'personally identifying'.

This could be captured in video or audio recordings, or notes and transcripts.

As user researchers, we are responsible for managing this personal data in a way that meets UK GDPR law and the Department's policies and processes, as well as ethically, in a treating our users safely and respectfully.

## Why this standard is important

If we fail to correctly manage personal data gathered in user research, this presents risks to our research participants, to the Department, and to ourselves:

- we could be breaking UK GDPR law, opening up the Department to legal challenges, fines, and negative publicity. Handling personal data incorrectly could be a serious disciplinary offence
- if people don't understand what we are using their data for, we are not treating them ethically or with respect
- if a person's personal data is accessed or used in a way that it shouldn't be, this could put the person at risk

## How to meet this standard

To ensure you are meeting this standard you must complete the following checklist. If you select yes for all questions, you have met the DfE standard. If you select no to anything or you're unclear, seek the advice of a senior or lead UR.

### You must:

- have completed your mandatory data protection awareness training
- have completed a 'high risk screening' on your plans for collecting personal data
- if required after the high risk screening, you have completed a full data protection impact assessment (DPIA)
- set up your personal data file storage correctly, using a SharePoint library with the 'UR personal data' applied to all files, and only give access to your personal data to the people who need it
- have more than one content manager set up for your personal data file storage
- ensure any software or web tools you are using to collect personal data are privacy assured
- gather informed consent from all participants (using the standard consent form templates where appropriate)
- give all participants an information sheet using the standard template, which links to the DfE privacy policy on GOV.UK
- anonymise all personal data during your analysis or, if you are pseudonymising, ensure you have the correct consent from participants
- know what to do if a participant withdraws their consent after research has taken place, or asks for a copy of their data

If you are building a panel or other large list of people, you <strong>must</strong>:

- have permission to do this from your lead user researcher or the head of user research

If you are sharing any lists of people with other user researchers, you <strong>must</strong>:

- have the correct consent from every person in the list
