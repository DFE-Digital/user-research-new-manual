                  <p class="govuk-body-l">We want DfE to be the best place in government to be a user researcher, and our research to always have genuine impact for our users.</p>
                  <p>Our user research standards help us all meet acceptable levels of quality, ethics and safety in our work.</p>
                  <p>Our principles help us understand what 'best practice' looks like, helping us deliver the highest quality work in the best possible way, developing our careers and the overall user research capability in the department while we do it.</p>
                  <p>With a couple of exceptions where we need to meet specific departmental processes, our standards and principles aren't intended to tell you <em>how</em> you should work. You and your team should develop ways of working that work for you, and that deliver high quality, safe and ethical user research.</p>

                    <p>Our standards and principles are owned, written and kept updated by user researchers across our DfE user research community. The head of user research is responsible for ensuring we have a set of professional standards, and this is part of <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00259/SitePages/DDT-Objectives.aspx">DfE's Digital Data Technology strategy (DfE intranet)</a>.</p>
