<p class="govuk-body-l">This principle is about advocating for user research in our teams, the department, and the wider world.</p>

It means that we always work in the open and share our findings widely: seeking out opportunities to talk inside and outside the department about our methods, ways of working, and what we have tried and learned. We celebrate our triumphs, and the achievements of our colleagues. We are advocates for user research - and for the user research community in Department for Education.

## How you know you're meeting this principle

As a user researcher at DfE, you’ll know you’re successfully doing this because:

- People in your team can clearly articulate what your role is, and how you work
- You have talked or presented at UR community or other showcases, about insights you’ve uncovered, or methods and ways of working you’ve used
- You have talked or presented outside of DfE, about your work in the department
- You're celebrating the great work done by other user researchers

## How we support you

Right now, we help you to meet this principle with:

- <a href="/templates-and-tools">Example teach-ins and presentations about user research for your team</a>                    
- <a href="/community-of-practice/community-meetups">Community meetups where you can call out great work by colleagues</a>
- <a href="">Access to the department-wide Show The Thing show and tell (DfE users only)</a>


<!--In the future (see <a href="/community-of-practice/how-were-developing-ur-at-dfe">our profession roadmap</a>), we want to have:-->

            
<div style="background: #ebf2f6; padding:20px 30px; margin-top:40px;">

    ## Discuss our principles

Give feedback or suggest changes to this principle <!--in the <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C05SEDKME2Y">#developing-user-research-standards channel in DfE Slack</a>, or--> by using the 'give us feedback' link at the top of this page.
