<p class="govuk-body-l">This principle is about researching in a way that is inclusive of all our users, and ensuring our teams understand them and their needs.</p>

It means that when we research, we include a broad range of users to make sure we have a deep and contextual understanding of all our users and their needs, using their own words to tell the right stories.

## How you know you're meeting this principle

As a user researcher at DfE, you’ll know you’re successfully doing this because:

- You recruit users diversely and inclusively, thinking about how to fully represent your service users across your research
- You are able to fluently talk about your users, the problems they face, and how your service area or project fits into wider aspects of their lives
- You understand how being a member of a minority or excluded group may impact a user's experiences of DfE and their needs of your service
- You know the population sizes of different groups of users of your service, and can demonstrate how your user research complements this data
- You have researched with users with disabilities, and users of assistive technology
- You are open to feedback from research participants, and use this to improve your practice

## How we support you

Right now, we help you to meet this principle with:

- <a href="/guidance/recruiting-participants/commercial-agency.html">Access to a specialist participant recruitment supplier, and support and guidance to use them</a>
- <a href="/guidance/recruiting-participants/self-recruitment.html">Self-recruitment guidance</a>
- <a href="/guidance/inclusive-research/index.html">Inclusive research guidance</a>
- <a href="/guidance/recruiting-participants/paying-incentives.html">Access to incentives, and comprehensive guidance for when they should and shouldn't be used in DfE</a>

In the future (see <a href="/community-of-practice/how-were-developing-ur-at-dfe">our profession roadmap</a>), we want to have:

- Our own participant panel to recruit from (this is already in beta in the Services for Schools portfolio)
- Participant recruitment specialists in each portfolio
- Access to a range of specialist participant recruitment suppliers
- Full inclusive research guidance, training and support
- A method to gather feedback from participants on their experience of our research
