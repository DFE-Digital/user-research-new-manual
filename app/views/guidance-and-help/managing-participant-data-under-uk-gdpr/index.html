Following this guidance will help you meet the <a href="/standards-and-principles/secure-handling-of-participant-data/">data management in user research standard</a>. You must always meet this standard. You should not collect and manage your data in any other way.

Before you start doing any user research activity in DfE, you should:

-	<a href="">Read the introduction page to this guidance</a>
-	<a href="">Complete your annual mandatory training</a>

Before and during each project you work on, you should follow the following guidance.

      <p>A DPIA is xxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
      Only research that is considered ‘high risk’ will need a full DPIA. Most user research will not need one. However, you must always confirm this by completing the DPIA check.

      This can take up to ten working days to be returned to you. You should plan to do this well ahead of conducting any research.
      
      You will need to have a good idea of your likely research methods and your participants, particularly any protected characteristics[link to (ICO?) guidance on protected characteristics] you will be using in your recruitment, or discussing in your research.

Ensure any third-party software you are using has been assured for use in DfE

If you are using software that stores personal data for example research session recordings, participant details, survey responses, etc, it must be security [and privacy?] assured.

Only use software that is available from or managed by the Specialist Tools team. Never install and use new software without permission.

Set up your file storage, access and retention label

Always store personal data in a SharePoint Workplace Library

The Department’s Sharepoint has been set up to ensure that you can manage personal data correctly. 

You can use the A new process is being developed where you’ll be able to choose to keep participant personal data in the SharePoint workplace for user researchers. With SharePoint, all personal data is kept in one secure place – this mitigates risk by making it easier to manage.
Research Operations have worked closely with the Knowledge and Information Management Team (KIM) to make it easier for you to manage personal data in SharePoint, including moving, setting permissions and deleting.
Using SharePoint helps keeps participant personal data safe because:
•	you can only access this with an invitation link 
•	you’ll only be able to see the folders you’ve given access to 
•	nobody else will be able to access the data you store in SharePoint without permission 
•	you can use retention labels to make sure your data is automatically deleted at the end of a retention period - for example, - if you set a retention label of ‘2 years’ the file will be automatically deleted after 2 years. If there isn’t a suitable retantion label for your documents, or you want to find out more, you can read about retention periods and labels on the DfE Sharepoint guidance pages.


Manage who accesses the files
Only give others access to personal data that has not been anonymised on a ‘need to know’ basis.
Where possible, user researchers should be the only people accessing personal data. As a user researcher you should limit access to the data to the smallest number of people possible.


Using personal data of people when recruiting participants

See also the UR participant recruitment standard

Save your participant list in the correct place, and delete copies

Make sure your participant list is saved in the in the Sharepoint space that you set up for this project. Delete any copies on your laptop, and ensure other project members do the same.

Emailing or sharing participant details

You will sometimes need to share details of your participants with other team members who are 

Using existing DfE data sources

Sometimes it is useful to use existing DfE data sources or lists of individuals to help you recruit participants for research. For example, this could be lists of people who have previously taken part in research, or users of a live service, or marketing mailing lists.

Before you can use this data, you must ensure that you allowed to use it. This will depend on how the data was gathered and, depending on the legal basis used to gather the data, what the individual has consented to their data being used for.

The person in the Department who manages this data should be able to confirm whether you are able to use this data for your recruitment, and how you can use it. If you or they are in any doubt, speak to the Office of the Data Protection Officer team (DfE intranet)..

Contacting organisations, not individuals

If the list you are using is of organisations (e.g. a list of administration email addresses for schools and trusts) rather than individuals, then this is not regulated under UK GDPR. 

You must follow any rules or guidance from manager of the data on how to use it.

Building a participant panel

A list of people who have agreed to take part in future research, or to be contacted throughout a project, often called a ‘panel’, can be a good way to recruit participants for your project.

XXXXXXXXXXXX

Note that if you are planning a large-scale panel (e.g. to cover recruitment for a programme or portfolio area) then you must first speak to the head of user research to ensure this fits with our future participant recruitment plans, and will not risk creating repeated contacts or burden on our users. 


Planning and delivering your research

Every time you write a research plan, you should check that the research method and data you are planning to collect is still within your DPIA agreement. If you are significantly changing your research method, or the categories of data you plan to collect, then you should re-do your DPIA triage.

Get the correct details in your information sheet and consent form

All participants must be given an information sheet which contains a clear description of what we will do with their data explains links to the DfE privacy policy [link to privacy policy on GOV.UK]. Use the standard information sheet template.

Consent forms

You must always also ask every participant, and keep a record of, consent to gather and use their data in your research. Note that this is not a requirement under the department’s data policies, because we are using the ‘XXXXXX’ legal basis to gather user research data. However, gathering consent is an ethical requirement of all user research in DfE, in order to meet our data management standard.

Consent forms contain personal data. You should store and manage them in the same place as the other personal data generated in your research.

Save your files correctly, and delete copies

Anything you capture or use that contains personal data must be kept in the Sharepoint space you set up for this project.

The files you need to save could include:
•	Video or audio recordings
•	Notes or transcripts, including those made by yourself or other team members, and any auto-generated transcripts from Teams or the specialist software you are using
•	Any research data entered directly by the user that contains personal data (eg poll responses, diary study entries)
•	Participant lists or recruitment data

Keep your files well organised, so you can easily find a specific participant’s data later, if asked. Make sure all files have the ‘user research’ retention label.

SUGGESTION FOR HOW TO ORGANISE FILES?

Delete any copies of data

Ensure any copies of files are deleted in your and your team members’ emails or Teams messages. Export and delete data from 3rd party software.

Researching with internal DfE staff

We frequently perform user research with DfE staff. You must manage your data in exactly the same way under GDPR as with external participants.

Additionally, there are some different ethical concerns and considerations with internal research, particularly in how to ensure your participants remain fully anonymous when you play back your research findings to people who may know them. Read our guidance on research with internal users.




Analysing and presenting your research findings

You must only use the data you gather in your research in the way that you have told the participant it will be used, and that they have consented to.

Anonymising data
As you analyse your data and develop insights, you must ensure that personal data is anonymised, unless a participant has explicitly consented otherwise. This means that nobody could use your findings to identify an individual research participant

Anonymising data isn’t always simple. Find out more about how to anonymise user research data.

Be careful when using quotations
Sometimes a direct quotation form a participant could identify a research participant, particularly if your research participants are know to your the people you are presenting your research to know your research participants,, for example 

Using video or photos in from your research
•	CONSENT? RETENTION? BLURRING?
•	VIDEO EDITING ON LAPTOP – DELETE DATA AFTERWARDS?



When your research is finished

Don’t delete your personal data after research

Our retention policy is 2 years, so you must keep your data for two years. Do not delete it sooner than this. 

Simply ensure that all personal data you have gathered has the correct ‘user research’ retention label, and the people who have access to the data are people who need access.

Sharing data outside of your team

You must not share the personal data you have gathered (including contact details) unless participants 

If a participant withdraws their consent

If an individual withdraws the consent they initially gave you, you must delete their personal data immediately. 

If this is before you have begun analysing your research, then you must not use this data in your analysis.

If it is already anonymised as part of your analysis, then you only need to delete the original stored data (if this has not already been deleted).

Subject access requests, or requests to remove personal details

An individual person can ask the Department for a copy of the personal data we hold about them.

If they do this, you may receive a request from the XXXXXXX team. If you still hold any personal data (e.g. raw recordings, transcripts, consent forms), you must provide these. 
If you have already anonymised your research data and deleted your raw research data, you do not have to supply your anonymised findings.
