Our goal is for every civil servant user researcher to be line managed by another, more senior, user researcher from your own portfolio of work. Because this isn't currently possible, due to the numbers of people we have at different grades, and the way user researchers are spread across the department, we have two alternatives: profession managers and mentors.

## Profession managers

If you aren't line managed by another user researcher, you might have a profession manager. This is a user researcher at a higher grade from a different portfolio, who has regular one-to-ones with you to talk about your performance and goals as user researcher, identify good professional development objectives and learning opportunities, and support you with questions that you have. They will attend one in three of your ABLE meetings with your line manager.

If you would like a profession manager, <a href="/community-of-practice/leadership-team.html">contact the head of user research</a>, who can arrange this for you.

## Mentoring programme 

The User Research mentoring programme gives you the opportunity to receive guidance from other user researchers across the community. Having a mentor gives you 1:1 support where you can get access to advice and feedback to develop your confidence and career progression.

This programme is open to any civil servant user researcher in DfE or our agencies.

<a href="https://forms.office.com/e/ANCBWC4ibS">Sign up to the User Research mentoring programme here</a>. State what you want to get from your mentoring relationship and how much time each month you can commit to it. You will then be sent a list of mentors available at DfE for you to select from.

### Become a mentor

You can also sign up to be a mentor on the User Research mentoring programme. By being a mentor, you are supporting others in their personal and professional development and sharing your experience to help another person's growth. 

<a href="https://forms.office.com/e/ANCBWC4ibS">Register your interest in becoming a mentor using this form</a> where you can provide a pen portrait of your skills, experience and interests.
