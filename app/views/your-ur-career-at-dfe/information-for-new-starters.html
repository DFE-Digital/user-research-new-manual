## Welcome to the Department for Education! 

We want DfE to be the best place in government to be a user researcher, and whether you're a new civil servant in a new permanent role, or a contractor with us for a shorter amount of time, you'll be made to feel very welcome.

Your line manager and team will ensure you know what you need to about the department and your specific service or project. If there is a <a href="/community-of-practice/leadership-team">lead user researcher</a> in your portfolio, you'll meet them in your first day or two to learn about your service area and users.

It's also important that you know about how we think about user research across the Department, and that you join up with our community of practice. Here are some links and guidance to get you started.

  ## 1. Tell Research Operations you've joined
  
  Make sure the <a href="/community-of-practice/research-operations.html">Research Operations team</a> know that you have joined the Department, if your line manager hasnâ€™t done this already. They will add to the correct user research Slack channels, book you onto an onboarding session, ensure you get invites to community meetups, and get access to some of the tools mentioned below.
  
  The Research Operations mailbox is <a href="mailto:UserResearch.Operations@education.gov.uk">UserResearch.Operations@education.gov.uk</a> 
  
  Please let us know: 
  
  - the date you started
  - whether you are a Civil Servant or contractor
  - your office location
  - the portfolio and team you have joined.

  Our UR community co-designed a laptop sticker to represent us: otters are collaborative, adaptable, effective as individuals but with a strong sense of community.
  
  Get your sticker from the <a href="/community-of-practice/community-meetups.html/#meet-our-community-organisers">community lead in your office</a> or <a href="/community-of-practice/leadership-team">contact the head of user research</a> who can post you one.

  ## 3. Attend a UR profession onboarding session

  The head of user research runs regular onboarding sessions for civil servant and contractor new starters. These cover our standards and principles, our user research community, how we manage personal data. They are an opportunity to ask any questions you have.

  Currently these are run for all civil servant new starters. From early 2024 we will run them for all contractors, too.
  
  You will be sent a calendar invite for an onboarding session. If you don't receive this in your first few days, <a href="/community-of-practice/research-operations/">contact Research Operations</a> to be added to a session.

  ## 4. Say hello in our our community Slack channels
  
  We have an active <a href="/community-of-practice/ur-slack-channels">UR community DfE Slack channel, #user_research</a>, as well as separate channels for each of our local communities.

  Say hello in the channel. We're very friendly!

  You can also use these channels to get advice and support, or to share your work.

 ## 5. Read our user research standards and principles

 Our <a href="/standards-and-principles">user research standards and principles</a> will help you understand what good looks like when planning and delivering user research at DfE, and the standards you're expected to reach.

 ## 6. Learn about DfE's service users
  
  Get an overview of the <a href="/research-insight/">users of DfE services and policies</a>. 
  
  Your team or lead user researcher will also tell you where you can find what we know about users in your specific service and policy area.

  You can also access the Department's <a href="/research-insight/other-insight-sources">Research Evidence Directory</a>, which contains social research and academic research reports, as well as other departmental sources of evidence, data and insight.

 </div>

  ## 7. Attend your first UR community meetup
  
  We have <a href="/community-of-practice/community-meetups/">user research community meetups</a> every 2 weeks, on Thursday afternoons. You can join them remotely, or we encourage you to come into the office to meet other user researchers in person. 
  
  All DfE user researchers, civils servants and contractors, are welcome to join these meetings.

  You will be sent calendar invites. If you don't receive them in your first few days, <a href="/community-of-practice/research-operations/">contact Research Operations</a>.

  ## 8. Book introduction to UR in government training (if you need to)
